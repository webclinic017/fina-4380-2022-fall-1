    "\n",
    "Lewinson clearly summarizes the capital asset pricing model (CAPM):\n",
    "\n",
    "> In this recipe, we learn how to estimate the famous Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and obtain the beta coefficient. This model represents the relationship between the expected return on a risky asset and the market risk (also known as systematic or undiversifiable risk). CAPM can be considered a one-factor model, on top of which more complex factor models were built.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> CAPM is represented by the following equation: $$E(r_i) = r_f + \\beta_i (E(r_m) - r_f)$$\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Here, $E(r_i)$ denotes the expected return on asset $i$, $r_f$ is the risk-free rate (such as a government bond), $E(r_m)$ is the expected return on the market, and $\\beta_i$ is the beta coefficient.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Beta can be interpreted as the level of the asset return's sensitivity, as compared to the market in general. Some possible examples include:\n",
    "> \n",
    "> - $\\beta <= -1$: The asset moves in the opposite direction as the benchmark and in a greater amount than the negative of the benchmark.\n",
    "> - $-1 < \\beta < 0$: The asset moves in the opposite direction to the benchmark.\n",
    "> - $\\beta = 0$: There is no correlation between the asset's price movement and the market benchmark.\n",
    "> - $0 < \\beta < 1$: The asset moves in the same direction as the market, but the amount is smaller. An example might be the stock of a company that is not very susceptible to day-to-day fluctuations.\n",
    "> - $\\beta = 1$: The asset and the market are moving in the same direction by the same amount.\n",
    "> - $\\beta > 1$: The asset moves in the same direction as the market, but the amount is greater. An example might be the stock of a company that is very susceptible to day-to-day market news.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> CAPM can also be represented: $$E(r_i) - r_f = \\beta_i (E(r_m) - r_F)$$\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Here, the left-hand side of the equation can be interpreted as the risk premium, while the right-hand side contains the market premium. The same equation can be reshaped into: $$\\beta_i = \\frac{cov(R_i, R_m)}{var(R_m)}$$\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Here, $R_i = E(r_i) - r_f$ and $R_m = E(r_m) - r_f$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will follow Lewinson's layout, but change his syntax to match the syntax we use elsewhere in the course.\n",
    "To move beyond the CAPM, we need the statsmodels package for linear regressions and rolling linear regressions.\n",
    "We will use statsmodels' formula API (advanced programming interface) to match R's regression formulas."

    "## Implementing the Fama-French three-factor model in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Lewinson clearly summarizes the Fama and French three factor model:\n",
    "\n",
    "> In their famous paper, Fama and French expanded the CAPM model by adding two additional factors explaining the excess returns of an asset or portfolio. The factors they considered are:\n",
    "> \n",
    "> - The market factor (MKT): It measures the excess return of the market, analogical to the one in the CAPM.\n",
    "> - The size factor, SMB (Small Minus Big): It measures the excess return of stocks with a small market cap over those with a large market cap.\n",
    "> - The value factor, HML (High Minus Low): It measures the excess return of value stocks over growth stocks. Value stocks have a high book-to-market ratio, while the growth stocks are characterized by a low ratio.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> The model can be represented as follows: $$E(r_i) = r_f + \\alpha + \\beta_{mkt} (E(r_m) - r_f) + \\beta_{SMB} SMB + \\beta_{HML} HML$$\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Or in its simpler form: $$E(r_i) - r_f = \\alpha + \\beta_{mkt} (E(r_m) - r_f) + \\beta_{SMB} SMB + \\beta_{HML} HML$$\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Here, $E(r_i)$ denotes the expected return on asset $i$, $r_f$ is the risk-free rate (such as a government bond), and $\\alpha$ is the intercept. The reason for including the constant intercept is to make sure its value is equal to 0. This confirms that the three-factor model evaluates the relationship between the excess returns and the factors correctly.\n",
    "> In the case of a statistically significant, non-zero intercept, the model might not evaluate the asset/portfolio return correctly. However, the authors stated that the three-factor model is \"fairly correct\", even when it is unable to pass the statistical test.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Due to the popularity of this approach, these factors became collectively known as the Fama-French Factors, or the Three-Factor Model. They have been widely accepted in both academia and the industry as stock market benchmarks and they are often used to evaluate investment performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lewinson uses new data to implement the Fama and French three-factor model, but we can use the same Amazon data from above to save ourselves some time and memory.\n",
    "As with CAPM estimations, we should estimate the three-factor model with one to three years of daily data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two common uses for the three-factor model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the coefficient estimate on the intercept (i.e., $\\alpha$  often called \"Jensen's $\\alpha$\") as a risk-adjusted performance measure. If $\\alpha$ is positive and statistically significant, we may attribute a fund manager's performance to skill.\n",
    "2. Use the remaining coefficient estimates to evaluate how the fund manager generates returns. If the regression $R^2$ is high, we may replace the fund manager with the factor itself.\n",
