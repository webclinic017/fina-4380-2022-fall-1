    "## Yahoo! Finance data have a survivorship bias!\n",
    "\n",
    "Yahoo! Finance only provides data for listed (active) public companies.\n",
    "When a public companies delist, Yahoo! Finance removes their data from the website and API interfaces.\n",
    "Companies delist for a variety of reasons, including failures, poor performance, buyouts, and acquisitions.\n",
    "Failures and poor performance are generally associated with large negative returns prior to delisting.\n",
    "Buyouts and acquisitions are generally associated with large positive returns prior to delisting.\n",
    "Regardless of the reason for delisting, delisted company data are are not available from Yahoo! Finance.\n",
    "The lack of delisted company data in data frame `russ` means that our analysis will have a [survivorship bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias):\n",
    "\n",
    "> Survivorship bias, survival bias or immortal time bias is the logical error of concentrating on the people or things that made it past some selection process and overlooking those that did not, typically because of their lack of visibility. This can lead to incorrect conclusions regarding that which (or those who) didn't make it.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Survivorship bias is a form of selection bias that can lead to overly optimistic beliefs because multiple failures are overlooked, such as when companies that no longer exist are excluded from analyses of financial performance. It can also lead to the false belief that the successes in a group have some special property, rather than just coincidence as in correlation \"proves\" causality. For example, if 3 of the 5 students with their state's highest college GPAs went to the same high school, it might lead to the notion (which the institution may even capitalize on through advertising) that their high school offers an excellent education even though it's actually due to their school being the largest in their state. Therefore, by comparing the average GPA of all of the school's students — not just the ones who made the top-five selection process — to state averages, one could better assess the school's quality (not quantity).\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Another kind of survivorship bias would involve thinking that an incident was not all that dangerous because the only people who were involved in the incident who can speak about it are those who survived it. Even if one knew that some people are dead, they would not have their voice to add to the conversation, leading to bias in the conversation. \n",

    "Here is my favorite survivorship bias joke:\n",
    "\n",
    "![XKCD 1827](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/survivorship_bias.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We should always been on the lookout for survivorship bias, and we should treat our analysis here as \"for training only\".\n",
    "Still, our findings below will be generally consistent with the academic research on momentum investing.\n",
    "If time permits, we will investigate momentum investing with survivorship-bias-free data from the [Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP)](https://www.crsp.org/)."
