It makes the language \"sweeter\" for human use: things can be expressed more clearly, more concisely, or in an alternative style that some may prefer. Syntactic sugar is usually a shorthand for a common operation that could also be expressed in an alternate, more verbose, form: The programmer has a choice of whether to use the shorter form or the longer form, but will usually use the shorter form since it is shorter and easier to type and read. \n\nI do not expect list comprehensions to be faster than for-loops, but it is hard to generalize and we would need to benchmark (`%%timeit`) specific cases.\nHowever, I consider the advantage of list comprehensions to be fast coding and comprehending instead of fast execution.\n[Here](https://realpython.com/list-comprehension-python/#benefits-of-using-list-comprehensions) is a clear discussion of the benefits of list comprehensions.","metadata":{},"id":"def6755a-f425-4fc8-99c6-93bc374fd6fa","cell_type":"markdown"}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.8.10","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python"},"toc-autonumbering":false},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
